Example Description

This example describes how to use ADC.


1.Prepare a DC power supply to provide a adjustable voltage.

2.Connect anode to EVB board GPIOF_0, and cathode to GND
  
3.Run the main function.

NOTE: 
	1. ADC need calibration to get correct voltage value by modifing OFFSET and GAIN_DIV.
